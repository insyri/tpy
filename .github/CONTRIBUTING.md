### Notes

Using the [Deno VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) and the [TypeScript VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript) at the same time disables the Non-Deno TypeScript language server. Disable either to use the other.
